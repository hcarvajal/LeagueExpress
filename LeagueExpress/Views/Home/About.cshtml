<h3>@ViewBag.Rules</h3>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            The Broward Premiere League will follow the FIFA and Plantation Adult Leauge Soccer Rules and Regulations, except
            a substituting player may come back to the game as the team feels it necessary.Plantation Adult League soccer rules will
            overwrite Fifa Rules since we play under their platform.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3>@ViewBag.Exceptions</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two yellow cards are equivalent to a red card and one single red card is also an automatic 1 game suspension.</li>
        <li>Any physical fight/altercation is an automatic 2 games suspension.</li>
        <li>No daunting of referees will be allowed; respectful communication acceptable</li>
        <li>
            No slide-tackles allowed. This is a measure to prevent or minimize the risk of injuries.
            Tackling another player is an automatic yellow or red card depending on the severity. The
            Referee is responsible to make the decision.
        </li>
        <li>Avoid arguing with referees, teammates, and other team.</li>
        <li>Good sportsmanship conduct is required from all players. That includes no fighting or Pushing…… </li>
        <li>
            Problems or concerns are addressed to the team captain during game time
            we ask that there is respectful/cordial communication between captains, referees, and players.
            In the event, a captain notices a player is argumentative and out of control with
            the referee, that captain has the responsibility to remove that player from the game for a 5 min cool off  time.
            Likewise, the referee can proactively act, sitting the player for a 5 minutes
            player continues with same behavior, that player is to be pulled off the game for that Occurrence.
        </li>
        <li>
            referee issues a yellow, red, PK to a player: done deal, except we encourage
            Fairness, conference with sideline referee if the call is obviously controversial.
            punishment can always accompany with calm demeanor…no escalation.
            most of the time explaining a call and allowing a player to say at least a word can solve
            problem  and misunderstanding.Everyone must understand, we play the game to exercise. It is not a World Cup event. We
            must install a friendly approach win or lose. All starts with the players’ attitudes and then the referees.
